This CD contains files associated with master thesis "Deep learning in collectables recogniction".
In particular, there are three folders:
datasets_csv - folder cointains dataset and cross-validation folds packed in the csv files. In csv there are links to coins images, there was no possibility to put images directly, due to CD's memory limitation and auction's images copyrights.  
MODELS - this folder contains models obtained for two folds - 1,2, models for folds 3,4,5 are not avaliable due to CD's memory limitation 800 MB. Please write on mail: jannsieradzki@gmail.com, in order to get acces to all models.
python_notebooks_code - this folder contains python notebooks used to train and evaluate models and code used to collect and preprocess dataset. 

In particular, there are following python notebooks:
coins_scraper - code used to collect coin dataset from numesmatic auction sites
dataAnalyse - this code has been used to analyse dataset
deep_learning_model_training - this notebook has benn used to train deep learning based models
folds_crossvalidation_creator - this code has been used in order to split dataset for 5-cross-validation folds
models_performance_tests - in this notebook models performane evaluation has been conducted
SIFT_BoVW_SVM_method - this notebook has been used to create SIFT_BoVW_SVM based models
